# CoreTelephonyDemo
A demo app to test the Core Telephony framework before integrating the framework into Voices.  Core Telephony classes monitor the states of outgoing calls. Will log when call has started, call is incoming, call was answered, and call was ended/disconnected. This is useful for iOS 9 and earlier, for iOS 10 check out the CallKit framework.
